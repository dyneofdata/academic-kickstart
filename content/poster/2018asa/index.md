title: "OR KPI self-service reporting"
poster: true
event: American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Practice Management

location: New Orleans, United States
summary: ""
abstract: "With operating rooms being one of the top revenue sources in the acute-care setting, it is crucial to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as case volume, room turnover, and block utilization in order to maximize efficiency. Putting such data in the hands of perioperative leaders empowers them to pivot quickly based on up-to-date operational data. We present our collaborative effort in creating a one-stop solution for OR KPIs as a case study in increasing self-service reporting capacity while lowering technical debt to meet a large academic organizationâ€™s data demand. We discuss the major access barriers to data that motivated this effort and our objectives. The implementation steps and user experience designed to meet those goals are demonstrated. We quantify the success in building a self-service data consumer community as well as in lowering  technical overhead and debt. Finally, we look to the future for meeting business challenges and opportunities for our organization."
