abstract: "A critical component of quality improvement is equipping providers with meaningful information regarding their practices. This requires not only obtaining accurate data but also presenting the data in an intuitive and efficient manner which allows providers to benchmark themselves to their peers. UW Health Department of Anesthesiology tracks a set of quantitative metrics in operational efficiency and clinical excellence that are also included in providers’ Ongoing Provider Practice Evaluation (OPPE).  We present our collaborative effort in creating a one-stop solution to consolidate these metrics into an automated one-stop-shop reporting interface which can be accessed by faculty, residents, or anesthetist at any time.  We discuss the major access barrier to data that motivated this effort and our objective. The implementation steps and user experience designed to meet those goals are demonstrated. We discuss the current use cases of the application in the OPPE process. Finally, we consider the application’s future role in facilitating the ongoing conversation and interventions for anesthesia quality improvement."
